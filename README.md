# Advent of Code 2021

Hopefully I'll have time to complete the
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles this year!

I will use it as an excuse to try out `golang`.


## Running the scripts

Each days puzzles are created as `main.go` scripts in separate `main` packages,
in the directories `day_1`, ... `day_25`.

    go run ./day_1/main.go


## Tests

I will try to implement simple tests in the different packages. For example run

    go test ./sonar

to run the `sonar` package tests.
